[h1][b]Genetic Recombination[/b][/h1]

This mod add a secondary function to the Gene Machine: Recombinate!

(it also adds a box lookup to both the normal Use and Recombinate functions for easier gene access)


Select two genes of the same type (normal or superior).

A helpful Lab Assistant will get to work recombinating the input genes (helpful Lab Assistant is automatically supplied).
This can be sped up using Syringes from Little Garden.

Once the [strike]Incubation Sacrifice[/strike] helpful Lab Assistant has finished recombinating the genes, you can Use the Gene Machine to get your new gene!

With this mod you will be able to get multiple body slots on the same gene (at an increased feat cost)

the amount of memories a recombinated gene will have is determined by the average amount of memories of the input genes +/- 1.
ie. gene1: 4 memories & gene 2: 3 memories. this averages to 3.5, however we round this up to 4. Giving the output gene a total of 3-5 memories randomly chosen from the input genes.


[h2]Future Plans[h2]
[list]
[*]Config for amount of memories
[*]Config for weighting the best memories to be more/less likely
[*]Config or upgrade system to allow for more genes to combine at once
[*]Chance for normal gene inputs to upgrade to a superior gene allowing for more memories
[*]It's own separate machine
